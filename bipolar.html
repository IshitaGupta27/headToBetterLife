            <p>
                Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood 
                swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, 
                you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania 
                or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. 
                These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.          
                Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some 
                emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong 
                condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, 
                bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

          ><h3 class="Title2">Mania and Hypomania</h3>
          Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. 
          Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, 
          as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization.
          <br>Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:
          <ul>
            <li>Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired</li>
            <li>Increased activity, energy or agitation</li>
            <li>Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)</li>
            <li>Decreased need for sleep</li>
            <li>Unusual talkativeness</li>
            <li>Racing thoughts</li>
            <li>Distractibility</li>
            <li>Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          ><h3 class="Title2">Symptoms</h3>
            <p>There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. 
                Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Bipolar I disorder</strong>- You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by 
                hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).</li>
              <li><strong>Bipolar II disorder</strong>- You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, 
                but you've never had a manic episode.</li>
              <li><strong>Cyclothymic disorder</strong>- You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of 
                hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).</li>
              <li><strong>Other types</strong>- These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due 
                to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.</li>
              </ul>
              Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of 
              bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, 
              which can cause significant impairment.<br><br> Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage 
              years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.

          <h3 class="Title2">Prevention</h3>
          <p>There's no sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health 
              disorder can help prevent bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening.
              <br>
              If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming 
              full-blown episodes of mania or depression:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Pay attention to warning signs</strong>- Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse.
                 You may have identified a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what triggers them. Call your doctor if you feel you're
                  falling into an episode of depression or mania. Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs. </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid drugs and alcohol</strong>- Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more 
                likely to come back.</li>
            <li><strong>Take your medications exactly as directed</strong>- You may be tempted to stop treatment — but don't. Stopping your 
                medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="Title2">Helping someone with Bipolar and related Disorder</h3>

            <p>
                People with bipolar disorder may not always think or communicate clearly, and they may lash out. 
                Try not to take it personally. You can learn to recognise and anticipate the extremes in mood that someone 
                with bipolar disorder experiences and understand their limits in controlling these ups and downs.
                <br><br>
                Bipolar disorder can strain families and friendships. It may help to organise a close group of friends to 
                share the load where possible. Family therapy can help family members understand their own limits, as well as 
                those of the person with bipolar disorder. 
                <br><br>
                Other useful actions you can take include learning more about bipolar disorders from the resources below, 
                encouraging someone who is showing symptoms to speak to a medical professional, and supporting them in developing 
                strategies to cope with stress and anxiety.
