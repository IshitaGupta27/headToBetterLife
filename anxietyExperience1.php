                            <blockquote>
                            As a kid, I would second guess everything that I did. I was told that I was “just shy,” and that I needed to practice doing things I didn’t want to do in order to get used to my shyness.
                            My mom would make me order food at restaurants and over the phone, in the hope of helping me overcome my irrational fear of interacting with others.By junior high, I hid myself in class projects and after school programs so that every moment of every day was accounted for, leaving no room for self-doubt to creep in. The adults told me I was ambitious, driven even.And perhaps they were right, but I see now that it was just my anxiety taking root in the deepest recesses of my personality and worldview. As I received my instructions with poise, my inner world was in utter chaos. Though I looked confident and powerful on the outside, both my mind and heart were racing. Thoughts of self-doubt and self-hatred competed for my attention, all but drowning out the real voices around me. A few years later, I was working dutifully in my salaried job, filling my days with even more tasks and chores in the hope of escaping the nagging voice that never went quiet. One night, my anxiety had become so intense that it oozed out into my body, causing my muscles to spasm so tightly that they pulled my rib cage out of place. With every breath, my ribs rubbed against the soft tissue on the inside of my chest, causing extreme pain, and even more anxiety. Finally, I went to a doctor, desperately searching for relief. He was able to pop my ribs back into place, before prescribing me oxycodone for the pain and Xanax for the anxiety.
                            “A lot of professionals would frown upon these prescriptions I’m writing you,” he said as he scribbled on his notepad. He looked up at me with a smirk and a twinkle in his eye.The voices that had controlled me for so long were finally silent. For that, I would have continued in this stupor for the rest of my life. Little did I know, I was in the throes of an addiction to two of the three most commonly abused prescription pills. It wasn’t long before my life unraveled.I eventually found a third doctor, and I hoped to gain a steady flow of prescription pills that would help me avoid my demons 24/7. This doctor, however, must have recognized the problems under the surface and told me that I should seek help, instead.
                            “You’re on a dangerous path, you know.” His gentle eyes forced me to make eye contact.
                            “What do you mean?” I didn’t want him to accuse me of having an addiction, though I was sure that is what he meant.“Opioids are dangerous. You might want to try working some things out with a therapist or looking for more sustainable treatment methods.” He started putting away his things, tinkering with his little instruments.
                            “Like what?” I began to sweat, and my heart began to race. I couldn’t imagine going back to a life where my anxiety was free to exist on its own, without the stifling prescription pills.
                            “Maybe that’s what a therapist could help you find out.” He put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed it. “Ask the receptionist for a list of therapists, if you’re interested.” With that, he left the room, and me sitting in it.
                            I’d like to say that I went straight to a therapist from there, but instead, I went in search of another doctor and another prescription. It wasn’t until about a year later when I exploded at a work colleague for a small and unimportant reason that I realized it was time to seek more sustainable treatment, just as the doctor had recommended. I eventually went into an outpatient detox program and got clean from my opioid and Xanax addiction. I attended individual therapy and group therapy, where I learned that exercise, a healthful diet, proper sleep, and meditation are among the best treatment methods for my anxiety disorder. I immersed myself back in my support network. I spent time with my friends and family who had loyally stood by my side, even when I disappeared into my 2-year high.
                            And you know what? The anxiety is still there. I’ll admit that I still crave the high, too. But, for the first time in my life, I can manage these bubbling feelings. I finally have the tools to mitigate them so that they don’t take over my mind. For the first time in my life, I can actually live my life, rather than claw my way through it. I finally know what those incessant thoughts of self-doubt are. I finally know how to recognize when the anxiety is tightening its grip on me. I finally know how to stop it all. My recovery from both anxiety and addiction has been a long and challenging process, and there are still days when I feel like I’d rather be in the warm embrace of a good oxy high than ever deal with mundane life again. But with therapy and self-care, I’ve learned to enjoy the mundane things and to accept the moments where I don’t enjoy them at all. After all, anxious thoughts, self-doubt, struggle, and boredom are all a part of the human experience. If we commit ourselves to learn how to incorporate these experiences into our daily life without losing touch with reality, then we can really enjoy life.
