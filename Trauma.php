            <p>
                According to the American Psychological Association (APA), trauma is “an emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, rape, or natural disaster.”
However, a person may experience trauma as a response to any event they find physically or emotionally threatening or harmful.


            </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                A traumatized person can feel a range of emotions both immediately after the event and in the long term. They may feel overwhelmed, helpless, shocked, or have difficulty processing their experiences. Trauma can also cause physical symptoms.
 </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Trauma can have long-term effects on the person’s well-being. If symptoms persist and do not decrease in severity, it can indicate that the trauma has developed into a mental health disorder called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Trauma and stressor-related disorders are a group of emotional and behavioral problems that may result from childhood traumatic and stressful experiences.


            </p>
              <br />
              
              <p>
                These traumatic and stressful experiences can include exposure to physical or emotional violence or pain, including abuse, neglect or family conflict. Observing a parent being treated violently, for example, can be a traumatic experience, as can being the victim of violence or abuse. Stressors such as parental separation or divorce or even more severe stressors such as emotional or physical neglect can cause problems when they are prolonged or not addressed by caring adults. Even a move or the birth of a sibling can be a stressor that can cause significant difficulties for some children.

            <h3 class="Title2">Symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.

                PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.

          <p>Several treatments can help people with trauma to cope with their symptoms and improve their quality of life.

        </p>
       
        <p>
              <br/>
            Treatments include:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Therapy </strong> - Therapy is a first-line treatment for trauma. Ideally, an individual will work with a trauma informed or trauma focused therapist.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seek social support</strong>-  If necessary, people can ask for support from others. This includes talking to trusted loved ones or joining a support group for trauma survivors.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Medication</strong>- Medication alone cannot cure trauma or PTSD, but it can help a person manage symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. A person should talk to their doctor about their options.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Mindfulness
            </strong>- Mindful breathing and other mindfulness-based exercises can ground people in the present, which can stop them from reliving the traumatic event.

            Studies suggest that mindfulness-based treatments are a promising intervention for PTSD, whether alone or in conjunction with other treatments.
            
            </li>
            <li><strong>A balanced lifestyle
            </strong>-A person with trauma may find it difficult to relax or to sleep well. However, sleep, relaxation, and diet all play a role in mental health. If possible, a person should try to:
<ol>
            <li>sleep for 7–9 hours a night</li>
            <li>eat a balanced diet</li>
            <li>avoid alcohol and drugs</li>
           <li>relieve stress with mindful or enjoyable activities</li>

My PTSD was triggered by several traumas, including a childhood laced with physical, mental, and sexual abuse, as well as an attack at knifepoint that left me thinking I would die. I would never be the same after that attack. For me there was no safe place in the world, not even my home.  ” <a style = "color : #1181ae;" href="https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/personal-stories/my-story-survival-battling-ptsd">..Read More</a></span

Who would've thought 6 years later, we would still be together and I would be saying "yes" to Campbell who was bending down in front of me on one knee in front of my whole family (I still can't believe he did that!). And just 3 weeks after that moment, would be the night that changed our lives.” <a style = "color : #1181ae;" href="https://www.aftertrauma.org/survivors-stories/campbell-and-lucy-s-story">..Read More</a>
