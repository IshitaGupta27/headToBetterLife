            <p>
                Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world. Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia is not a split or multiple personality. Schizophrenia involves a psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person can’t tell what’s real from what’s imagined. At times, people with psychotic disorders lose touch with reality. The world may seem like a jumble of confusing thoughts, images, and sounds. Their behavior may be very strange and even shocking. A sudden change in personality and behavior, which happens when people who have it lose touch with reality, is called a psychotic episode.

              <p>
                They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self-medicate.

            </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.

            <h3 class="Title2">Symptoms</h3>
            <p><b>Early Symptoms:</b>
                The condition usually shows its first signs in men in their late teens or early 20s. It mostly affects women in their early 20s and 30s. The period when symptoms first start and before full psychosis is called the prodromal period. It can last days, weeks, or even years. It can be hard to spot because there’s usually no specific trigger. You might only notice subtle behavioral changes, especially in teens. This includes:

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                
              <ol>
              <li> A change in grades.</li>
              <li> Social withdrawal            </li>
              <li> Trouble concentrating            </li>
              <li>Temper flares            </li>
              <li>Difficulty sleeping            </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
<br/>
<p>
   <b> Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia</b>
In this case, the word positive doesn’t mean good. It refers to added thoughts or actions that aren’t based in reality. They’re sometimes called psychotic symptoms and can include:

</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <ul>
<li><p><b>Delusions: </b>These are false, mixed, and sometimes strange beliefs that aren’t based in reality and that the person refuses to give up, even when shown the facts. For example, a person with delusions may believe that people can hear their thoughts, that they are God or the devil, or that people are putting thoughts into their head or plotting against them.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hallucinations:</b> These involve sensations that aren't real. Hearing voices is the most common hallucination in people with schizophrenia. The voices may comment on the person's behavior, insult them, or give commands. Less common types include seeing things that aren't there, smelling strange odors, having a funny taste in your mouth, and feeling sensations on your skin even though nothing is touching your body.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Catatonia:</b> In this condition, the person may stop speaking, and their body may be fixed in a single position for a very long time.</p></li>
    </ul>


    <br/>
    <p><b>Disorganized Symptoms of Schizophrenia</b>These are positive symptoms that show that the person can’t think clearly or respond as expected. Examples include:

    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talking in sentences that don’t make sense or using nonsense words, making it difficult for the person to communicate or hold a conversation</li>
            <li>Shifting quickly from one thought to the next without obvious or logical connections between them            </li>
            <li>Moving slowly</li>
            <li>Being unable to make decisions</li>
            <li>Writing excessively but without meaning
            </li>
            <li>Forgetting or losing things
            </li>
            <li>Repeating movements or gestures, like pacing or walking in circles</li>
            <li>Having problems making sense of everyday sights, sounds, and feelings

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br/>
    <p><b>
        Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia

    </b>The person will have trouble:</p>
          
<br/>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding information and using it to make decisions (a doctor might call this poor executive functioning)
        </li>
        <li>Focusing or paying attention
        </li>
        <li>Using their information immediately after learning it (this is called working memory)
        </li>
        <li>Recognizing that they have any of these problems

        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<br/>
    <p><b>
        Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia

    </b>The word "negative" here doesn’t mean "bad." It notes the absence of normal behaviors in people with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include:
</p>
          
<br/>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of emotion or a limited range of emotions
        </li>
        <li>Withdrawal from family, friends, and social activities
        </li>
        <li>Less energy
        </li>
        <li>Speaking less
        </li>
        <li>
            Lack of motivation

        </li>
        <li>Loss of pleasure or interest in life
</li>
<li>
    Poor hygiene and grooming habits


</li>
    </ul>

          <h3 class="Title2">Treatment</h3>
          <p><b>The most effective treatment strategy for schizophrenia</b> involves a combination of medication, therapy, lifestyle changes, and social support.
        </p>
        <p><b>Schizophrenia requires long-term treatment.</b>Most people with schizophrenia need to continue treatment even when they’re feeling better, in order to prevent new episodes and stay symptom-free. Treatment can change over time, though. As your symptoms improve, your doctor may be able to lower the dosage or change your medication.</p>
          <p>
              <br/>
            Treatments include:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Therapy </strong> - can help you improve coping and life skills, manage stress, address relationship issues, and improve communication. Group therapy can also connect you to others who are in a similar situation and are able to offer valuable insight into how they’ve overcome challenges.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seek social support</strong>- Friends and family vital to helping you get the right treatment and keeping your symptoms under control. Regularly connecting with others face-to-face is also the most effective way to calm your nervous system and relieve stress. Stay involved with others by continuing your work or education. If that’s not possible, consider volunteering, joining a schizophrenia support group, or taking a class or joining a club to spend time with people who have common interests. As well as keeping you socially connected, it can help you feel good about yourself.</li>
            <li><strong>Medication</strong>- for schizophrenia works by reducing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and disordered thinking. But it is not a cure for schizophrenia. It is also much less helpful for treating symptoms such as social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and lack of emotional expressiveness. Finding the right drug and dosage is also a trial and error process. While medication should not be used at the expense of your quality of life, be patient with the process and discuss any concerns with your doctor.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid alcohol, drugs, and nicotine</strong>- Substance abuse complicates schizophrenia treatment and worsens symptoms. Even smoking cigarettes can interfere with the effectiveness of some schizophrenia medications. If you have a substance abuse problem, seek help.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Manage stress</strong>-High levels of stress are believed to trigger schizophrenic episodes by increasing the body’s production of the hormone cortisol. As well as staying socially connected, there are plenty of steps you can take to reduce your stress levels. Try adopting a regular relaxation practice such as  yoga, deep breathing, or meditation.

            <p>
                Caring for a loved one with schizophrenia can be challenging, but it doesn't have to feel impossible. The first step is to learn what you can about the condition. Many people find schizophrenia intimidating because of the nature of the symptoms experienced. Learning from mental health professionals and other resources can help you gain useful information.

              <br />
              <p>
                <b>Find Support</b><br/>
                Even though your role is to support your loved one in their treatment journey, remember that you will need support as well. Many times caregivers are focused so much on helping others that they neglect to take time for their own well-being. Finding local support groups and even online group support resources can be a wonderful outlet to share experiences and find encouragement.
